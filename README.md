# ANIMAL SHELTER APP

- The goal of this project is to create a simple animal shelter app for practice purposes. The app will store information about the animals in the shelter provided by the user in a simple database.
- The program allows users to enter the following details of the animals: animal type, name, date of birth, size, color.
- The database primary key is the animal's name. **Each animal's name has to be unique.**

## Required modules:

- os
- re
- time
- sqlite3
- **pandas**

## Planned features:

- In future updates, users will have the option to add additional details for the animal such as special diet, medication, readiness for adoption, adopters, and date of adoption.
- Groups will be implemented in future updates, allowing users to create groups and assign animals to them. These groups can be used to specify special details for the animals, such as temperament and compatibility with other animals.
